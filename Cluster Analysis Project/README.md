# Cluster Analysis Project
This project showcases an example of using unsupervised learning techniques to create and interpret clusters of customers for a sports facility. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook and a CSV file containing customer data.

## Files
- **Cluster_Analysis_Project.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook that contains the code and analysis for the cluster analysis project.
- **Sports.csv**: The dataset used in the analysis, containing customer information for the sports facility.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to perform cluster analysis using unsupervised learning techniques.
By clustering the customers of a sports facility, we aim to uncover patterns and groupings that can provide insights into customer behavior and preferences.

## Usage
Open the `Cluster_Analysis_Project.ipynb` notebook and just follow the steps within the notebook to perform the cluster analysis.
The notebook includes comments and explanations that guides the user through the entire analysis process.
