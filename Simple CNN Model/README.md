# Cervical Cancer Project
This project showcases an example of using a Convolutional Neural Network to perform multi-class classification on images of isolated cervical cells. The goal is to demonstrate a simple yet effective CNN model built with Keras, utilizing the Kaggle dataset containing manually cropped images of cervical cytology screenings.

## Files
- **Cervical_Cancer_Project.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for the image classification model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the SipakMed dataset, which contains images of isolated cells that have been manually cropped. The dataset is available on Kaggle and can be accessed via the following link:
[Kaggle Dataset - Cervical Cancer Largest Dataset (SipakMed)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prahladmehandiratta/cervical-cancer-largest-dataset-sipakmed)


## Usage
Open the `Cervical_Cancer_Project.ipynb` notebook and just follow the steps within the notebook.
The notebook includes comments and explanations that guides the user through the entire process.
