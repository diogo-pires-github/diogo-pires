- **`README.md`**

## **3 - Supervised Learning Project**

### **Overview**
This project explores various data exploration, preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to solve both a binary and a multi-class classifcation using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### **Contents**
- **`__pycache__/`**
- **`Hospital_Readmissions_binary.ipynb`**
- **`Hospital_Readmissions_multiclass.ipynb`**
- **`train.csv`**
- **`utils.py`**

## **4 - Unsupervised Learning Project**

### **Overview**
This project focuses on unsupervised learning techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction. Methods such as Hierarchical clustering, K-Means, PCA, and t-SNE are demonstrated.

### **Contents**
- **`Cluster_Analysis_Project.ipynb`**
